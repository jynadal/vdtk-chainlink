    # ðŸ§Š VDTK Introduction

    ---

    **VDTK** is a centralised trusted Start-up for **Vid30** project.

    ## Inspiration
    Have you ever paid something which you already have or can have for **FREE**?
    I do this with a DVD I already have except the DVD player and also a movie I could watch for free on TV the past day.

    ## What it does
    VDTK is a **Proof Of Reserve**. It's a SAAS plateform for users to start making there decentralize video library of there favorite movies, actors, actress, directors, etc cross streaming plateform.
    On Avertising, Subscription or Branding  Video on demande.
    Even on there famillys and friends video library.
    The all project VDTK and Vid30 will be a streaming on web3 without data center and movies broadcasting right (by contraints), eco impact, social impact, very smart and all legal.
    The secret sauce is the help of Web3, so I can't explain deeper my web3 strategy.
    An african quote:
    _"He who swallows a complete coconut have absolute trust in his anus."_

    Users :
    With the help of Chainlink RWA, they will make there decentralize movies library backed by VDTK proof of Reserve (secret sauce).
    VDTK will create some limited NFT by movie (1000).
    They can sell them (NFT+Movie or the all library).
    They can buy some movies from our futur marketplace or another user to complete there library.
    Users can watch them on our streaming plateform VID30.
    They can got datas about there movies collection to.
    They can search there movie they want to see and get some proposal on **free plateform (even SVOD if subscribed)**, there friends/ familys one or a link for VOD.

    Users (**_Scenariste_** profil):
    - will be rewarded for being Proof of Reserve for some new users.
    - will get some task to do for AI data and get reward on crypto
    - can do **Storage provider** or **Computer Provider** with Swan partner
    - they will also store some movies for Vid30


    ## What's next for VDTK
    Knowing more about RWA, Oracles and launch my project in less than 1 month.
    Creating my video library for demo.
    I'm collecting some movies because at least old video tape will be expensive.
    Some person are interresting to join me as co-founder.
    I'm looking to have a awesome team of pirate. Some **underdog** person who **think outside the box**
