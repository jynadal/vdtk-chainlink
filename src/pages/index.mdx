**VDTK** is a feature of my other project. **Vid30** (The first streaming plateform on Web3.)

    ## Inspiration
    Have you ever paid something which you already have or can have for **FREE**?
    I do these with DVD I already have except the DVD player and a movie I could watch for free on TV the past day.

    ## What it does
    VDTK is a Proof Of Reserve. It's a SAAS plateform for users to start making there decentralize video library of there favorite movies, actors, actress, directors, etc cross streaming plateform.
    On Avertising, Subscription or Branding  Video on demande.
    Even on there famillys and friends video library.

    Users :
    With the help of Chainlink RWA, they will make there decentralize movies library backed by VDTK proof of Reserve (secret sauce).
    VDTK will create some limited NFT by movie (1000).
    They can sell them (NFT+Movie or the all library).
    They can buy some movies from our futur marketplace or another user to complete there library.
    Users can watch them on our streaming plateform VID30.
    They can got datas about there movies collection to.
    They can search there movie they want to see and get some proposal on **free plateform (even SVOD if subscribed)**, there friends/ familys one or a link for VOD.

    Users (**_Scenariste_** profil):
    - will be rewarded for being Proof of Reserve for some new users.
    - will get some task to do for AI data and get reward on crypto
    - can do **Storage provider** or **Computer Provider** with Swan partner
    - they will also store some movies for Vid30

    ## How we built it
    At the begginning it was a nextJS template and switch to Astro Js for this Hackathon.
    Some Python private code on AWS API Gateway and Lambda for scrapping and make data and waiting to work with **QuickNode**.
    Knowing Movies on Netflix, Prime, AVOD or BVOD can be crucial for VDTK and Vid30 and all DeFi on selling and buying movies on this ecosystem.
    Some code on AWS Bedrock for making poster of movies collection or all library. Custom poster will be NFTs.

    **Chainlink:**
    Adding CCIP for connecting and messaging all protocol
    Create Smart contract for subcribing (RWA)
    _SocialFi with Lens protocol_
    Chainlink Function on back-end and front-end.
    **Front-end:**
        - newsArchive. => https://github.com/jynadal/vdtk-hainlink/tree/rwa/src/lib/newsArchiveABI.json
        - newsArchiveABI. => https://github.com/jynadal/vdtk-chainlink/tree/rwa/src/lib/newsArchive.js
        - about page. => https://github.com/jynadal/vdtk-chainlink/tree/rwa/src/pages/about.mdx

    ## Challenges we ran into
    For this hackathon, I have to learn and build my MVP or Demo without blockchain and Artificiel Intelligent knowledge.
    I will did it with an old computer, on a month where there are many interesting events for networking (like Paris Blockchain week, Viva Technology, some Meetup on eco &social impact and some pitch contest)

    ## Accomplishments that we're proud of
    I have a great idea and I found the way to manage all thing to make this idea real without a very good knowledge on web developpement, without money, only with what I learn on Youtube, Bootcamp Chainlink, ... .
    And the "Get rich or died trying" mindsdet.

    ## What we learned
    I discover many Chainlink product for my Start-Up project like.
    RWA: A single NFT poster for users to put all his movies (NFTs)
    Using **AI and NFTs**  (That already can be a single project)
    Chainlink function
    CCIP

    ## What's next for VDTK
    Knowing more about RWA, Oracles and launch my project in less than 1 month.
    Creating my video library for demo in 2 weeks.
    I'm collecting some movies because at least old video tape will be expensive.
    Some person are interresting to join me as co-founder. I'm looking to have a awesome team of pirate. Some **underdog** person who **think outside the box**
