# ðŸ§Š About Vid30, VDTK and Bankable

    ---

    **Are you ready for the first Decentralised streaming plateform on Web3!**

    ## Inspiration
    Have you ever paid something you already have or can have for **FREE**?
    I do this with a movie I already have or could watch for free some day before.
    A cinephile project for cinephiles.

    ## What it does
    Vid30 is 3 project in one.

    Like an iceberg, **VDTK** is the huge and imerged part of the project.
    Then come the marketplace **Bankable** and the **streaming plateform**

    **VDTK:**
        - Proof Of Reserve.
        - Real Word Asset.
        - Minting all assets and contract.
        - Manage Storage provider.
        - Manage Computer provider.
        - Storage all movies and digital them.
        - Manage Vid30 marketplace and streaming plateforms partners.

    **Bankable:**
    Is the Vid30 marketplace for primary market on selling dMovies, get cinephile and mint there movies.
    I read Swan documentation and one of my goal with my project is to have also social impact.
    I would like to help peoples in need to make passive income with Web3 an AI.
    Managing some "Storage provider" and "Computer provider" for VDTK/Vid30 use and also for partner can be social impact I would like.

    **Streaming plateform :**
    Streaming platform can bring people on web3 but all things have to be be simple.
    My customer segment are up to 40 years old and I'm open for partners and Open Source for streaming plateform.
    **Sony, Samsung, LG, ... **.

    ## Some use case
    **Real Cinephile, Web3 investor or curious:**
    Cinephile with more than 20 movies in his attic or garage.
        - He can **watch his favorites movies at anytime and everywhere**
        - He can apply and send his movies to VDTK and watch them for **FREE**.
        - By watching his movies, he will **get reward** by watch also commercials.
        - VDTK will mint a dMovie and he will be the owner.
        - At the end, he can **sell, buy,** ... his movies on **Bankable** or on secondary market.

    **Premium :**
    Those who want just watching all movies by will paying a subscription monthly .
        - They will get 5 or more on there video library (dMovie).
        - By watching there movies and also the commercials, they will get reward and paid less.
        - They could watch all movies existing on DVD or Video tapes (98% of movies).

    ## What's next for Vid30
    Knowing more about RWA, Oracles and launch all project.
    Creating my video library for demo.
    I'm collecting some movies because at least old video tape will be expensive.
    Some person are interresting to join me as co-founder. I'm looking to have a awesome team of pirate. Some **underdog** person who **think outside the box**
